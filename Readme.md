# Body Fat Prediction Project

This project aims to predict body fat percentage using various body measurements and machine learning models.

## Files

- **[bodyfat.csv](bodyfat.csv)**  
  This is the main dataset used in the project. It contains measurements for 252 men, including:
  - Density (from underwater weighing)
  - BodyFat (percent, from Siri's equation)
  - Age, Weight, Height
  - Neck, Chest, Abdomen, Hip, Thigh, Knee, Ankle, Biceps, Forearm, Wrist (circumferences in cm)

- **[bodyfat.ipynb](bodyfat.ipynb)**  
  This Jupyter notebook contains the complete workflow for the project:
  - Data loading and exploration
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing
  - Feature engineering (e.g., BMI, ratios)
  - Model training and evaluation (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, etc.)
  - Saving the trained model and transformer

- **.qodo/**  
  This is a system or configuration directory, possibly used by your development environment. It does not contain project code or data.

## Usage

1. Open `bodyfat.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
2. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and model training.
3. The dataset `bodyfat.csv` is required in the same directory.

## Notes

- The notebook demonstrates multiple regression techniques and feature engineering.
- The best-performing models are highlighted in the results section.
- The project saves the trained model and transformer for# Body Fat Prediction Project
